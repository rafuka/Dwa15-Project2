This project is a password generator inspired by the [xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/936/).

The user can specify the number of words to use (from 1 to 5), and the number of special characters and/or digits.

When clicking on the *Generate!* button a new password is generated.

The words were taken by scraping a website with common english words.

It was built from scratch on PHP.
